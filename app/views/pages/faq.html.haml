  %h2 Frequently Asked Questions

  %h3 Can I have Hound check my entire repository for style?

  %p
    No. we don't recommend doing that. We say "Don't rewrite existing code to
    follow this guide."

  %p
    It can be dangerous to re-write a lot of code for just style reasons. It
    can introduce functional regressions, which are a higher-level concern than
    style.

  %p
    We believe the right approach is to convert a codebase over time, one pull
    request at a time, to conform to a style guide. Only focus on style in
    diffs and make smaller changes that ideally have tests associated with
    them.

  %p
    It's the same approach we use when adding tests to a repository that is
    lacking them. It most often does not make sense to stop forward progress on
    the project to write tests for everything. Only write tests for any code
    that is touched going forward.

  %h3 Do you offer GitHub Enterprise support?

  %p
    Not at the current time. A user has shared their method of getting it to
    work
    = link_to('here in this GitHub issue',
      'https://github.com/thoughtbot/hound/issues/426')
      but it is an not officially supported approach.
